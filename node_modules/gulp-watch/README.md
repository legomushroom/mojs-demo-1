# [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)-watch [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Dependency Status][depstat-image]][depstat-url]

File watcher, that uses super-fast [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) and emits vinyl objects.

## Installation

Run `npm install gulp-watch`.

## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp'),
    watch = require('gulp-watch');

gulp.task('default', function () {
    gulp.src('css/**/*.css')
        .pipe(watch('css/**/*.css'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/'));
});
```

> __Protip:__ until gulpjs 4.0 is released, you can use [gulp-plumber](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-plumber) to prevent stops on errors.

More examples can be found in [`docs/readme.md`](/docs/readme.md).

## API

### watch(glob, [options, callback])

Creates watcher that will spy on files that were matched by `glob` which can be a
[`node-glob`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) string or array of strings.

Returns pass through stream, that will emit vinyl files
(with additional `event` property) that corresponds to event on file-system.

#### Callback `function(vinyl)`

This function is called, when some events is happens on file-system.
All incoming files that piped in will be grouped and passed to `events` stream as is.

 * `vinyl` â€” is [vinyl](https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl) object that corresponds to file that caused event. Additional `event` field is added to determine what caused changes.

Possible events:

 * `add` - file was added to watch or created
 * `change` - file was changed
 * `unlink` - file was deleted

#### Options

This object is passed to [`chokidar` options](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api) directly. Options for [`gulp.src`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp#gulpsrcglobs-options) are also available. If you do not want content from `watch`, then add `read: false` to the `options` object.

#### options.[ignoreInitial](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#path-filtering)
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

> Indicates whether chokidar should ignore the initial add events or not.

#### options.events
Type: `Array`  
Default: `['add', 'change', 'unlink']`

List of events, that should be watched by gulp-watch. Contains [event names from chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#events).

#### options.base
Type: `String`  
Default: `undefined`

Use explicit base path for files from `glob`. Read more about `base` and `cwd` in [gulpjs docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#options).

#### options.name
Type: `String`  
Default: `undefined`

Name of the watcher. If it present in options, you will get more readable output.

#### options.verbose
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

This options will enable verbose output.
